# CyberShield Student Edition - Demo Script

## Opening
Hi, I’m Jeffy, and this is **CyberShield ** — a network security visualization tool I built entirely on my own.  
The goal is to help students detect and prevent common cybersecurity risks within a campus network environment.

## Feature Walkthrough

### 1. Traffic Monitor
- Let’s start with the traffic monitoring module.  
  Here you can see a **real-time table and chart** showing simulated network traffic.  
- In this example, I’m simulating traffic coming from different IP addresses into the school network, so you can quickly spot unusual spikes or suspicious patterns.

### 2. Phishing URL Check
- Next is the phishing detection module.  
  I’ll type in a safe URL like `example.com`, and then a suspicious one like `login-secure-paypal.com`.  
- As you can see, the system marks the first one as **Benign** and flags the second one as **Suspicious**.

### 3. Weak Password Audit
- Finally, let’s run the weak password checker.  
  I’ll test a few common weak passwords like `123456` , and then a strong password like `Abc123!@#`.  
- The results show exactly how each one scores, so users can understand the difference between weak and strong passwords.

## Closing
And that’s the demo. Everything you just saw was designed, coded, and tested by me.  
CyberShield Student Edition is lightweight, easy to run, and most importantly, it’s built for real educational use — helping students build safer network habits.
