# CyberShield

## Overview
CyberShield is a project I built in high school to practice and understand basic cybersecurity concepts.  
It shows how threats like unusual traffic, phishing links, and weak passwords can be detected and explained in a simple, visual way.  

## Features
- **Traffic Monitor (Simulation)** – generates sample packets and displays them with charts.  
- **Phishing URL Check** – flags suspicious URLs using keyword matching.  
- **Weak Password Audit** – tests inputs against a list of common weak passwords.  

## How It Works
Written in Python with a few common libraries:  
- `scapy` for simulating packets  
- `pandas` for handling and exporting data  
- `matplotlib` for visualization  

## Reflection
This was my first full project combining programming with cybersecurity ideas.  
It’s simple, but I learned how small scripts can model real issues.  
In the future, I want to add more advanced detection, possibly using machine learning.
